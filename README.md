# Pong
Hello World! This is by far the simplest game you will ever make. I have made several different versions, and may 
get around to uploading those at some point (I know you can't wait for my seizure pong version :). The coding of this 
game was very simple. It uses Java Swing and AWT, as you can see most of my other projects use. 


# To run
Go to the folder under bin. Also make sure you have Java installed and JAVA_HOME set in your environment variables. Then run:
```
Pong.jar
 ```
 and play to your heart's content.
